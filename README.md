# GANs

A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a generative modeling method that automatically learns and discovers patterns in data inputs, generating plausible outputs based on the original dataset. 

GANs can train generative models by emulating a supervised approach to learning problems. A GAN contains two sub-models that compete and feed off each other to produce more realistic outputs: 

* The generator model—trained to generate new outputs.
* The discriminator model—classifies inputs as realistic or fake. It attempts to identify whether an input originates from the original dataset of the generator model. 

This adversarial approach helps to improve the generator model’s capabilities until the discriminator model cannot distinguish between real and generated inputs.
